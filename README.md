# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradients in older browsers that might not fully support the `linear-gradient` CSS function.  The problem manifests as unexpected visual output; the gradient might not render correctly, instead showing a solid color.

The `bug.html` file showcases the problematic code, and `bugSolution.html` offers a solution using fallback techniques.
