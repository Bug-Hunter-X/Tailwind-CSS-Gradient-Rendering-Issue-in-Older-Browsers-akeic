```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- fallback color -->
  <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
    <!-- Content here -->
  </div>
</div>
```
This solution utilizes a fallback background color (`bg-blue-500`) to ensure that *something* is displayed, even if the gradient is unsupported.  The gradient is still applied within this fallback, ensuring that modern browsers still get the desired effect.
