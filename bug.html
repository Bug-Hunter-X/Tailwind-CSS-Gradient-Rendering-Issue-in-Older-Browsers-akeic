This code uses Tailwind CSS gradient classes. However, if the browser doesn't support the `linear-gradient` function (very unlikely in modern browsers), the gradient might not render correctly, resulting in unexpected visual output.  There's no specific error message, but the background will likely appear as a solid color (usually the starting color).
